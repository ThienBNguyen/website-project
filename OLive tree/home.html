                    Every month we provide a new challenge on the home page that gives our customers the opportunity to win our products. This month's challenge invites you to select the olive oil flavor of the month out of the three flavors indicated. If you select the correct flavor in one try, you'll receive a 24-ounce bottle of that flavor in the mail. Good luck playing the "Flavor of the Month" game!
